#division always returns a float

x = 10
y = 3

result = x / y
print(result)

#two forward slashes means that it will return a whole number, in this case, 3

# two asterisks raises it to the y power

# a percentage symbol is the modulo, the remainder after taking x/y 

#remember in Python, right side is evaluated before the left

#  x += 1 is almost the same as x = x + 1

#when you assign, you are breaking the variable and what it had previous connection to, 'referencing' to a new value
