#A raw string means nothing more or nothing less than 'let's just double all the backslashes', so to do so, just put an 'r' in front of the string
#If you need a path in windows, than you should really use a raw string
#basically, In Python, a raw string—denoted by prefixing the string with r—treats backslashes (\) as literal characters, making it especially useful for file paths and regular expressions where escape sequences would otherwise cause errors.
