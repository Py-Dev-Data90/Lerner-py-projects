#python will never guess, thus, it will not guess what type of  is inside a string
x = 1
y = '2'

# x+y would throw a type error, then, so we use int() to turn y into a different type, from a string to an integer
#int()  aka nothing, gives you zero

# in the int of a float, int(1.5), just the int portion would be returned, so 1.
